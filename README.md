Code Description for the Paper "**Unveiling the Complex Morphologies of Sessile Droplets on Heterogeneous Surfaces**"

This repository contains the code used in the research paper titled "Unveiling the Complex Morphologies of Sessile Droplets on Heterogeneous Surfaces". Below are descriptions for different substrate patterns implemented in the code:

**N-Polygon Substrate Patterns**

For N-polygon substrate patterns, please refer to the square.ipynb file for comprehensive explanations of the code. The implementation for other N-polygon substrates follows a similar structure to the square example but utilizes different equations for the partial derivatives.


**Non-Regular Patterns**

For non-regular substrate patterns, such as the flower pattern, detailed code descriptions can be found in the corresponding example named flower_pattern.ipynb.
